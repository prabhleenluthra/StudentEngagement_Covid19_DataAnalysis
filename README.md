# __Student Engagement Levels During COVID-19 Pandemic__

## __Project Overview__
This project, "A Data-Driven Exploration of Student Engagement Levels throughout the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States," examines the digital engagement of students across the U.S. during the pandemic. Using data from LearnPlatform, the study highlights trends in engagement across various socioeconomic, demographic, and regional factors, providing valuable insights into the challenges and disparities faced by students in a remote learning environment.

## __Objectives__
To analyze student engagement patterns in digital learning platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic.
To explore the impact of factors like socioeconomic status, locality (urban vs. rural), and government funding on engagement levels.
To identify key findings and implications for future digital education strategies.

## __Source:__ 
LearnPlatform COVID-19 Impact on Digital Learning Dataset.

## __Content:__
Data includes student engagement metrics, socioeconomic factors, geographic locality, and product usage across U.S. districts.

## __Methodology__

### __Data Cleaning:__
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats for consistent analysis.
### __Feature Engineering:__
Created new features to capture demographic influences, such as socioeconomic indicators and regional engagement patterns.
### __Data Analysis:__
Analyzed engagement trends based on location, product usage, and socioeconomic characteristics.
### __Visualization:__
Developed charts and graphs to visualize key insights, focusing on variations in engagement levels across different demographic groups.

## __Key Findings__
Higher Engagement in Rural Districts: Despite lower technology ownership, rural districts demonstrated higher engagement levels.
Impact of Socioeconomic Factors: Students from higher-income districts showed consistent engagement, whereas lower-income areas exhibited more variability.
Product and Service Demographics: Certain digital tools saw higher engagement in specific districts, influenced by local needs and available resources.

## __Technologies Used__

__Python:__ For data processing and analysis.
__Pandas:__ Data manipulation and cleaning.
__Matplotlib/Seaborn:__ Data visualization.
__Jupyter Notebook:__ For exploratory data analysis.

## __Results and Implications__

This project underscores the importance of equitable access to digital resources, especially in lower-income and rural areas. Findings suggest that tailored digital education strategies could bridge engagement gaps and improve learning outcomes.

## __Getting Started__

__Clone the Repository:__
git clone https://github.com/prabhleenluthra/StudentEngagement_Covid19_Analysis.git
__Run the Analysis:__ Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute cells in sequence to explore the data and visualizations.

## __Future Directions__
Analyze engagement changes over extended periods.
Investigate additional factors such as internet speed, device quality, and family support.
Expand the analysis to compare engagement between urban, suburban, and rural localities.
